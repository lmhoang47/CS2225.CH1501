1. Python files *.ipynb
- Install the TensorFlow Object detection API
- Select the model for training:
 + File "Vehicle_Walking_RCNN.ipynb": faster_rcnn_inception_v2
 + File "Vehicle_Walking_SDD.ipynb": ssd_mobilenet_v2
- Image, Label, Annotation, Training vs Testing data
- Process images & labels
- Download Tensorflow model which contains Object Detection API
- Generate Tensorflow record
- Download the Base Model which was selected above and is used for training
- Configure the Training Pipeline
- Create Tensorboard link for monitoring the training process
- Begin to train model
- Export the trained model for reuse - inference
- Test video & picture
- Tensorboard
- LabelImg instruction
- Image resize
